<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a senior student majoring in Software Engineering at [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn/). Currently, I am a Research Assistant at [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/). Previously, I worked with [Prof. Yue Feng](https://fengyue-leah.github.io/) during my visit to the [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/). My research interests include LLM, Multimodal Models, and LLM-driven Agent Frameworks.
