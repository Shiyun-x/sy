<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Research Assistant at the [Multimedia Laboratory (MMLab)](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/), The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), working with [Prof. Xiangyu Yue](https://xyue.io/). I received my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology, advised by [Prof. Zhiying Tu](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/tzy). Previously, I worked with Prof. [Prof. Yue Feng](https://fengyue-leah.github.io/) during my research visit to the University of Birmingham. My research interests include Large Language Models (LLMs), Multimodal Models, and LLM-driven Agent Frameworks.
